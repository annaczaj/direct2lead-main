To Add:
CSV lead creation, add lots of leads stored in csv files. (I have a script i wrote that seems to work decently well. I used it to upload users, needs to be formatted for leads and put into program)
SMS Notifs for users on new comment and new leads (Need to setup twilio account for this I think)
